Hitchhiker-Prophecy

This is the submission for the Swvl iOS Software Engineer Challenge.


## Architecture
**VIP**


## CocoaPods
This project uses cocoa pods for including external dependencies. 
Please note : that AlamofireImage is replaced by SDWebImage because of memory leaks issue occuring .



CocoaPods offers easy and fast integration. Install it like so:

```
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

To get started, move inside your iOS project folder and run

```
pod init
```

This creates a Podfile, which will hold all your dependencies in one place. After adding your dependencies to the Podfile, you run

```
pod install
```

## Unit Testing
The project includes few unit tests to demonstrate testing of different layers of VIP for the Home scene and Character details scene
